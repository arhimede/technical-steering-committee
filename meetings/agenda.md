## Items to Discuss

### Push live the getlaminas.org new design

[The preview is here](https://preview-1-hy2vwsq-2ja7ciew2nbkm.us-2.platformsh.site/)


Another month passed, PR dance continued, small fixes were done here and there.

We need to push it live asap, because the actual content of the website does not reflect the reality.

It is quite a confusion related to the post "Laminas MVC is retiring", some people understood that the 
entire Laminas is retiring .
We must add more content too, later, and reflect the changes in focus of the project.
