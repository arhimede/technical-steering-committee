## Items to Discuss


### PHP Download & Installation Instructions 

Do we want to be mentioned in the [PHP downloads](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) page ?
In this case, we need to create a setup page in documentation, about how to install Mezzio.
Example from [Symfony Setup](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html)

### Private repo for private Laminas project related items

We may want to avoid the situations where:
- source files for current Laminas design are lost ( we have only .svg)
- logins for Mastodon @getlaminas account is lost 
- and so on 

So it may be a good idea to create a private repo where we can store login and source files ?
