### Maintainer Nomination

[@gsteel](https://github.com/gsteel/) would like to nominate  Richard McHale ([@ramchale](https://github.com/ramchale)) as a maintainer of `laminas-filter`, `laminas-inputfilter` and `laminas-validator`.

Richard has provided a number of high quality contributions to laminas-filter that were instrumental in getting v3 over the finish line, and has expressed his interest in continuing to help triage issues, review PRs and perform maintenance duties as a member of the team.
