## Items to Discuss

### Major release for laminas-session

    In order to implement servicemanager v4, we need to release a new major version, V3, of this laminas-session package.
    See those PR's: https://github.com/laminas/laminas-session/pull/102  and https://github.com/laminas/laminas-session/pull/103

    In the current bugfix release, all functions that will be removed in V3 was marked as `@deprecated`.

### Email accounts @getlaminas.org 

    In the past we were looking for email providers, and we should discuss if this Tuta solution works for us.
